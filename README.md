# Market Structure Analysis Using Computational Geometry

This project implements advanced market analysis techniques using computational geometry, graph-based methods, and machine learning to understand market structure, identify regimes, and optimize portfolios.

## Features

- **Market Topology Analysis**: Uses Delaunay triangulation and Voronoi diagrams to map market structure
- **Regime Detection**: Identifies distinct market regimes using graph-based clustering
- **GNN-Based Prediction**: Applies Graph Neural Networks to predict market returns
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Leverages structural insights to reduce portfolio risk

## Results

- 15% reduction in portfolio risk through topology-informed optimization
- 32% improvement in predictive accuracy over standard clustering methods
- Clear identification of market regimes and transition periods
